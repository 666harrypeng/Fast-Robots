Hi there! I am Yiyan Peng, a year-three undergraduate student majoring in Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), and I am currently doing my exchange semester at Cornell University.

I am interested in the combination of robotics and AI. Particularly, I am exploring more about Embodied Intelligence, hoping to construct a genuinely autonomous and intelligent robot someday!
